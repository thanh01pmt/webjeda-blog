Adding a custom domain is fairly easy compared to adding a subdomain to github hosted website. I will explain adding a domain to Github here.

You may have a website with a URL which looks similar to [sharu725.github.io](http://sharu725.github.io). But what you want is something like [webjeda.com](http://webjeda.com). So how to change it to a custom domain like webjeda.com?

First thing is that you should own a domain name. You can buy it from godaddy, namescheap or somewhere. If you already own one, then continue to Step 1.


##Step 1: Adding CNAME file to the gh-pages branch of your repository.

Go to the repository where you have hosted your website and click on 'New File'

Name the file as CNAME without any extension. Now, inside the CNAME file write your domain name you would like to host it as. I have written <pre>truejewls.in</pre>

Now commit your file to the repository. Make sure you are still in the gh-pages branch.


##Step 2: Adding A record in the DNS Zone Records
Login to the website where you purchased your website. Go to your domain and click on something similar to 'Manage Domain'

Now go to **DNS Zone File** option

Now click on **Add Record** and add an **A** record with following configuration

Host: @
Points to: 192.30.252.153 or 192.30.252.154

Click on Finish and Save.

And that's about it. Do not rush though. It will take a while to propagate. So grab a cup of coffee. Once you are done, hit your URL :)
