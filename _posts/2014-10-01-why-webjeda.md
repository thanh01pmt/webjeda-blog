While I was working at Cognizant Technology Solutions I always used to have a tab open on my internet browser which was github.com. Cognizant had learning period of two months in which I googled a lot about it. I was wondered by the contributions people do there. People were creating cool plugins, websites, providing information, documentations and steb by step guide for coders.

By then I was learning html, css and a little javascript. I used to use the code I learned in github to see how it comes up. It was not always a positive result. I had to debug a lot and adapt the code rather copy pasting it. 

I created a lot of websites like


[RedGadgets](http://redgadget.github.io/)

I ralized (very late though) that web designing is my passion. I kept on learning more about html5. I also started learning Android application development. I never thought I can make it a business but I fully enjoyed making modern websites.

Learning was always there. Even now for a web designer it is hard to figure out how to use github for his/her development. I learned github through many tutorials and I still feel there is a lot to learn.
